# Managing files

Common tasks on any filesystem include navigating to a directory; listing the files; 
creating folders; and copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and folders.
In classic Unix, these tasks are all performed with command line tools: 

- `cd` (change directory)
- `ls` (list files) 
- `mkdir` (make directory)
- `rmdir` (remove directory)
- `cp` (copy)
-  `mv` (move)
-  `rm` (remove)

Part of learning [Linux](../../getting-started/before-you-start.md/#roar-uses-linux)
is becoming familiar with these commands. 

If you prefer a more "graphical" user interface, two options exist.

The [Thunar][thunar] graphical file manager is available
from the Portal Interactive Desktop
( menu item Applications/Accessories/Thunar File Manager)
or an `ssh -X` terminal session (`thunar` at the command line).

Alternatively, the [Roar Collab Portal][portal] top menu under Files/Home
opens a window that enables file management
(moving, copying, renaming, making and deleting folders).
