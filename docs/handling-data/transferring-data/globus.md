# Globus

Globus is a web-based tool designed for robust, large scale file transfers between established
endpoints. 

ICDS has established endpoints on Roar Collab, Archive, and OneDrive. Many other 
institutions have their own established endpoints, and users can set up personal endpoints on 
their own machines, allowing for direct file transfers between any of these points.

## ICDS Endpoints

ICDS Hosted Endpoints:

| Filesystems | Endpoint |
| ---- | ---- |
| Roar Collab | Penn State ICDS RC |
| Archive | Penn State ICDS Archive |
| PSU OneDrive | Penn State ICDS OneDrive |

By default, connecting to the Roar Collab endpoint will land in your Home directory. 
To navigate to other locations on RC or Archive, change the "Path" field.

To see shared collections and files on OneDrive, go up one folder from the start location.

More detailed information on file transfers with Globus can be found in the [Globus 
documentation](https://docs.globus.org/how-to/get-started/)

## Transfers to and from your local machine

To transfer files to or from a personal machine, a mapped collection must be established by installing the 
Globus Connect Personal client.

Operating System specific instructions can be found in the Globus documentation for:
