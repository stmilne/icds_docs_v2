# File Transfers on the Portal

## Portal File Manager

The File Manager app on the [Roar Collab Portal](../../running-jobs/portal.md) offers a very 
intuitive interface for file management. Files can be moved, edited, uploaded, and downloaded 
with relative ease using this utility. Users should limit the use of the RC Portal file manager 
utility to dealing with small files only.

!!! warning "Upload Button Issues"
	There is a known issue where the "Upload" button on the portal does not function as 
	expected. Please utilize the "Globus" button to transfer files using the [Globus](globus.md) interface

## Uploading to the Cloud

The Firefox browser is available from the [Roar Collab Portal Interactive Desktop](../../running-jobs/portal.md)

Once an Interactive Desktop session has been created, Firefox can be used to access popular cloud storage providers
such as OneDrive and Google Drive.
