# Managing files

Common tasks on any filesystem include navigating to a directory; listing the files; 
creating folders; and copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files and folders.
In classic Unix, these tasks are all performed with command line tools: 

- `cd` (change directory)
- `ls` (list files) 
- `mkdir` (make directory)
- `rmdir` (remove directory)
- `cp` (copy)
-  `mv` (move)
-  `rm` (remove)

Part of learning [Linux]()../getting-started/before-you-start.md/#roar-uses-linux)
is becoming familiar with these commands. 

If you prefer a more "graphical" user interface, two options exist.

The [Thunar][thunar] graphical file manager is available
from the Portal Interactive Desktop
( menu item Applications/Accessories/Thunar File Manager)
or an `ssh -X` terminal session (`thunar` at the command line).

Alternatively, the [Portal][portal] top menu under Files/Home
opens a window that enables file management
(moving, copying, renaming, making and deleting folders).

## File permissions

If you have access to group space on Roar, located at
`/storage/group/<PIuserID>/default`,
the default file permissions and ownership are
```
drwxr-s-- 2 root <PIuserID>
```

The `s` setting in the group permissions means 
every file and folder created within the group folder
will have the same group read `r` permission.
However, files created elsewhere and moved into group 
have the permissions they were created with.
To change them, use [`chmod`][chmod]:
[chmod]: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/chmod.1p.html
```
chmod g+r <filespec>
```
More generally, chmod can be used to add or remove (+ or -) 
permissions to read (r), write (w), or execute (x),
for the user (u), group (g), or others (o).

## Packing files

To copy or transfer many files,
or an entire directory of files, possibly with subdirectories,
it is convenient to first make a single large file of the entire contents,
using the Unix command `tar`.  The command
```
tar -cf <tarfilename>.tar <filespec>
```
creates (`-c`) a single .tar file (`-f`) (sometimes called a "tarball"),
containing the entire contents of `<filespec>`.
With option `-v` (as in `tar -cvf`), tar operates "verbosely", 
listing every file added.

To make a tarball of everything in the current directory:
```
tar -cf myTar.tar *
```

tar with option `-z` (as in `tar -czf`)
makes a "zipped" (compressed) tarball.
Compressing text files often makes the tarball much smaller;
compressing binary or image files is usually pointless.

To unpack a tarball (option `-x` for "extract"):
```
tar -xf myTar.gz 
```
