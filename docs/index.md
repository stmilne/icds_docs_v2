# Roar User Guide

Roar is the central computing facility for Penn State, 
operated by the Institute for Computational and Data Sciences (ICDS).

## Collab and Restricted

Roar is actually two distinct clusters, with distinct filesystems:
Roar Collab (RC) and Roar Restricted (RR).
RR is designed for working with restricted data. 
Access to and storage on RR is provided
to principal investigators (PIs) who work with restricted data 
and must comply with stringent data storage standards.

Most material in this online User Guide applies to both RC and RR. 
But access to RR and data transfer to and from RR are handled differently.
See [Accessing RR](restricted/rr-getting-started.md)
and [Data transfer](restricted/rr-handling-data.md) for details.
