# Accessing RR

To request an account on RR, Send an email to <icds@psu.edu>: 

 - indicate that the request is for Roar Restricted;
 - include the requestor's access ID;
 - provide the restricted storage owner's name and access ID.

Note: Non-faculty accounts require approval from a PI sponsor.

Before granting access to RR, users will be assigned the RR training module via Penn State LRN. 
This training is required by the Office of Information Security (OIS) 
to maintain compliance with Authority to Operate (ATO) granted to ICDS.
