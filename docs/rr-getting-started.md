# Roar Restricted

Roar Restricted (RR) is designed for working with restricted data. Group storage on RR is provided on an as-needed basis to principal investigators (PIs) who work with restricted data and must comply with stringent data storage standards.

Most material in the User Guide applies to both Roar Collab (RC) and RR. This addendum addresses items unique to RR.

## Accessing RR

To request an account on RR, Send an email to icds@psu.edu : 

 - Indicate that the request is for Roar Restricted
 - Include the requestor`s access ID.
 - Provide the restricted storage owner's name and access ID.

Note: Non-faculty accounts require approval from a PI sponsor.

Before granting access to RR, users will be assigned the RR training module via Penn State LRN. This training is required by the Office of Information Security (OIS) to maintain compliance with Authority to Operate (ATO) granted to ICDS.


## Connecting to RR

To access RR, users must have a paid compute or storage allocation.

Users can connect to RR only via the [Roar Restricted Portal](<https://rrportal.hpc.psu.edu>).
The RR Portal can only be accessed from within the Penn State network or using the
