## Node attributes

Roar Collab contains a wide variety of different hardware configurations. To find out 
specifics about the hardware on different nodes, there are several helpful tools.

 - `lscpu`: displays information about the CPU and its capabilities
 - `nvidia-smi`: displays information about the GPU (if present).

Using these commands within your jobs can provide details on the hardware it is running
on.
