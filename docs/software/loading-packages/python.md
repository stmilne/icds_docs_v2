# Managing Python Packages

Python is a widely-used programming language, preloaded on Collab,
which is greatly extensible in its capabilities by loading additional packages.


## Installing packages using pip

To load Python packages, use `pip` with the `--user` flag:

```
pip install --user <package>
```

Sometimes, user python package libraries can become too large for storage in the home directory. 
To correct this issue, see [Solution to common quota issues in home](../../handling-data/file-storage.md/#solution-to-common-quota-issues-in-home).
